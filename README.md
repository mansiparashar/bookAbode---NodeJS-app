#  **bookAbode**


**Starter application** <br>
Developed while **learning nodeJS**

**bookAbode** is meant to be a platform for users to discover new books of various genres when they find themselves in a rut and to recommend books they feel should be shared,and maintains a database of the same.
Reading is a habit I have had since ever, and after a point of time, I would find myself at a loss for new books to read. Having like-minded people put up the most interesting books they have read builds an unexhaustive reading list for all the users and help them step out of their comfort zones.
